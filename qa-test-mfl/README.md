# Home test task

**What do you already have supplied to you?**
-----
 * 3 tests hitting against http://automationpractice.com/index.php
 
**What is already supplied to me?**
-----
* Java
* JUnit
* Maven

**What do you need to do?**
----

First step: Place the latest Chrome driver under the /test/java/resources folder, as this is where the tests are looking. 
Our plan was to supply this, but security filters say otherwise.


You need to improve given automated tests as much as possible in 1-2 hours.
We all know we can go down a rabbit hole when working and perfecting our code, so PLEASE do not do that.


**What are the only requirements from you?**
----

Convert to TestNG, and incorporate the page object model framework. 

**What if I am ridiculously fast and have a few minutes remaining?**
----

If time remains, feel free to include one or more of the following into your solution:
* the use of more efficient locators;
* logging;
* taking screenshots on failed tests;
* generation of a human readable report;
* generating of random values for insignificant test data (e.g. a new user);
* run parallel tests and/or 
* run tests on different browsers;
* reading test data from file.

**What do I do when I am done?**
--
Save it to your GitHub account and send us a link directly to that repository. 

**Evaluation Criteria**
-------------------

Again, it cannot be stressed enough that you are not expected to spend more than 2 hours working on this. 
If time is running short, please feel free to comment in the code what you would ideally do.

We will mostly be reviewing the stated required enhancements, but the following will also be considered:
* The tests incorporate the requirements listed above.
* The tests are clean and follow best practices (with respect to Java & Selenium)
* The tests execution does not take more time than initial version.
* The code is documented and is easy to-follow.
* The application is supplied with all the information required for us to run and validate it as well as a description and purpose of used additional libraries.

One last time, there are no wrong answers. We are interested in seeing _your_ flavor of test organization. You are free to script as you see fit.:)
